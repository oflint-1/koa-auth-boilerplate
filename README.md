# Koa Authenticated API Boilerplate
Boilerplate for a KoaJS API with authentication built in. This can be used as the basis for a fully fledged API.

## Adding routes
Add a new files in ```/routes``` and add it to ```/routes/api.js```:
```
router.use("/path", require("./file"));
```
You can then write controllers and import them into the new routes from ```/controllers```.

## Adding models
Simply add a new mongoose model into ```/models``` and import and use it anywhere within the application.
